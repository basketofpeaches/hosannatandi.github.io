                        <p>"People are like that.
                            When you’re not there, you want to be there, and when you are, you don’t want to.
                            Who said people are animals of wisdom?
                            For me, obviously, we are animals of regret.
                            People change, just as I've change.
                            There is nothing permanent in the world.
                            Everything is just a happening passing through." - <i>Agust D</i>, "People"</p>
