                        <p>"Same day, same moon.
                            24/7 every moment repeats.
                            My life is in between.
                            Jobless twenty-somethings are afraid of tomorrow.
                            It’s funny, you think anything
                            is possible when you’re a kid.
                            When you feel how hard it is to get through a day.
                            Keep feeling like the
                            “Control” beat, keep downloading it.
                            Every single day is a repetition of ctrl+c, ctrl+v." - <i>BTS</i>, "Tomorrow"</p>
