                    <h3> Quotes and Lyrics</h3>
                        <p>"Even if it turns out you didn’t do too well on the exam, there’s no need to feel so defeated.
                            It may feel like your world is collapsing, when you don’t get the results you want, but that’s not true.
                            That’s not how our lives work. What’s important is that you get back up." - 2019 VLIVE</p>
                        <!--<li>It’s important to really see your shadow and see where it is. Your shadow’s always going to be attached to you,
                            it’s always going to be at your feet and it’s always going to follow you. So it’s a matter of accepting it or not …
                            It’s not about facing your shadow or fighting your shadow, but just acknowledging the fact you have your shadow.
                            And that really brings us comfort and peace. -2020 BTS GLobal Press Conference</li>
                        <li>People are like that
                            When you’re not there, you want to be there, and when you are, you don’t want to
                            Who said people are animals of wisdom?
                            For me, obviously, we are animals of regret
                            People change, just as I've change
                            There is nothing permanent in the world
                            Everything is just a happening passing through. - Agust D- People</li>
                        <li>Same day, same moon
                            24/7 every moment repeats
                            My life is in between
                            Jobless twenty-somethings are afraid of tomorrow
                            It’s funny, you think anything
                            is possible when you’re a kid
                            When you feel how hard it is to get through a day
                            Keep feeling like the
                            “Control” beat, keep downloading it
                            Every single day is a repetition of ctrl+c, ctrl+v. -BTS- Tomorrow</li>
                        <li>Yes, to someone I’m spring, to another winter,
                            I’m the end to someone and start to another,
                            For someone I’m happiness, for someone I’m sadness,
                            A lullaby to someone and noise to another,
                            I’ll be with you at your birth and your end,
                            Remember we’re always together anywhere,
                            I’ll always console your life,
                            So just lean on me and rest sometimes.- Lee Sora- Song Request (ft. Suga)</li>-->
