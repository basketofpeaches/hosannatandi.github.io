                        <p>"It’s important to really see your shadow and see where it is. Your shadow’s always going to be attached to you,
                            it’s always going to be at your feet and it’s always going to follow you. So it’s a matter of accepting it or not …
                            It’s not about facing your shadow or fighting your shadow, but just acknowledging the fact you have your shadow.
                            And that really brings us comfort and peace."- 2020 BTS GLobal Press Conference
