            Surrealism: art style that illustrates the unconscious mind
        </p>

            Dalí's first surrealist period started in 1929. His contribution to this movement is called the “Paranoid critical transformation method.”
            This method is a mental exercise of tapping into the subconscious to enhance artistic creativity. Dalí would use this method to create a reality from his dreams 
            and subconscious thoughts, mentally changing reality to what he wanted it to be and not necessarily what it was. We have all used this method when we
            find different shapes in the clouds in the sky. But for Dalí, it became a way of life. It's 
            important to note he did this without the use of drugs.

            His work demonstrated a careful classical technique, influenced by Renaissance artists, that contradicted the "unreal dream" space that he created with his strange characters.
            By 1930, Dalí had become a renowned figure of the Surrealist movement. Marie-Laure de Noailles and Viscount and Viscountess Charles were his first patrons (he produced the persistence of memory under them).

            Expelled from the surrealist movement in 1934 (just a group of surrealist artists), supposedly because their political views did not align.
            Officially, Dalí was notified that his expulsion was due to repeated "counter-revolutionary activity involving the celebration of fascism under Adolf Hitler",
            but this expulsion didn’t stop him from creating.
